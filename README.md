# My Practical Projects

Welcome to my practical projects repository! Here, you will find a collection of projects I've developed throughout my courses and learning journey. It's important to note that many of these projects were created when I was in the early stages of my front-end development learning, so they may contain errors and less-than-optimal practices.

## Objective

This repository serves as a record of my progress and learning over time. My intention in sharing these projects is to showcase my learning journey, from the early stages to developing more advanced skills.

## Contents

The projects in this repository cover a variety of front-end topics and technologies, including (but not limited to):

- Basic HTML and CSS
- JavaScript
- Front-end frameworks and libraries
- Responsive design
- Good development practices

## Notes

As mentioned earlier, these projects may contain errors and follow less-than-ideal practices, especially in the older projects. By revisiting these projects, I can learn from my own mistakes and see my progress over time.

## Contributions

If you come across any improvement suggestions, error corrections, or have guidance to offer, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your feedback is valuable and can help improve my projects.

Thank you for exploring my repository and being part of my learning journey!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
